<h2 text align="left">Who is Ila Sachani?</h2> 
<img src="ilasachaniyellow.jpeg" alt="My image" width="400" height="400" border="5" align="right";>
<p>Ila Sachani is a Kathiawar embroidery artist, a famous embroidery in Gujarat.</p>
<p>She was born on nineteenth of December in 1895 in Amreli, Gujarat. She did  </p>
<p>embroidery art on many things such as on cusions, bedcovers, pillows, and more.</p>
<p>Ila Sachani faced a big challenge since she was born, as she had both of her hands</p>
<p>loosened. But that did not stop her from being what she wants to be.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 text align="left">How did Ila Sachani get famous?</h2>
<p>Even though she did not have hands to use needles and make embroidery art, Ila Sachani did not</p>
<p> lose hope. Her mother and grandmother, who were skilled at Kathiawar embroidery stitching were</p>
<p>single-minded to help overcome her challenges. It was of course not an easy task, but Ila</p>
<p>accepted the challenge with determination. Already at a young age, she became expert at </p>
<p>stitching. Her younger brother and sister also helped and supported her. Ila knew many </p>
<p>other styles too, such as <i> Kachhi, Kashmiri, Luckwani,</i> and others.At first, she crafted </p>
<p>fine designs only for her family and friends. But as Ila's magnificient talent spread across</p>
<p>the village, people started admiring her for the work she did. Word reached the government office</p>
<p>in Surat.They decide to display some samples of her embroidery at a state exhibition.</p>

<p>Soon people observed the beauty woven by Ila's feet and readily purchased the creations.Ila </p>
<p>was no more a hidden talent, but famous! After this, she participated in more exhibitions,</p>
<p>at national levels. <b>Ila Sachini, once a daughter of a farmer, who faced tough challenges,</p>
<p>worked hard and became a celebrated artist and received the President's Medal.</b></p>

<h2 text align="left">What can we learn from Ila Sachani?</h2>
<p>Ila Sachani proved, through her creations, that challenges can be turned into victories with </p>
<p>focus, hard work, positivity, and that we should never give up. Her embroidery, created with</p>
<p>her feet, reminds us that art has the power to rise above physical boundaries and touch the soul.</p>
