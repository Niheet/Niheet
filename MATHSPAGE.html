<h2 text align="left">Who is Brahmagupta?</h2> 
<p>Brahmagupta was an Indian mathematician and astronomer who lived in the 7th century CE.</p>
<p>He was born in Bhinmal, in present day Rajasthan. Brahmagupta was best known for his </p>
<p>discovery of Arithmetic and Algebra, Geometry, and the natural number '0'. One of the </p>
<p>main findings was of '0'.</p>

<p>In ancient times, it was not know to denote nothing, as something, so at that time, '0'</p>
<p>was not considered as a number. But it was not until 628 AD, that '0' became an important</p>
<p>part of the number system. Brahmagupta, an Indian mathematician and astronomer, took the idea</p>
<p>of nothingness, and symbolized it as an oval. althoug, Brahmaguta gave us the rules to use zero</p>
<p>in calculations defining its very first use in calculations. But he never introduced zero for its</p>
<p>second purpose.</p>

<h2 text align="center">Aryabhata's contribution on Brahmagupta's idea.</h2>
<p text align="center">Everything that we used '0' for was not only because</p>
<p text align="center"> of Brahmagupta's discovery. It was another mathematician</p>
<p text align="center">Aryabhata, who used '0' as a placeholder. Soon, this </p>
<p text align="center">revolutionary knowledge spread around the world. And, </p>
<p text align="center">                          mathematicians in other places started using '0' in their calculations.</p>
